<p>The transportation system in New York City has been a large part of my life growing up. 
Even though I grew up in Queens, I commuted to high school in downtown Brooklyn and graduate school in Harlem. 
This commute was a large part of my day and more often than not, the commute would take 60 to 90 minutes, one way.</p>

<p>
Despite this, I felt truly blessed and thankful for the Metropolitian Transportation Authority (MTA) for 
providing a service that allowed me to live in the greatest city in the world. 
Without them, getting around would seem almost impossible in a city of this scale.</p>

<p>
However, after using MTA services my entire life, I did notice some things.  
</p>
<p>
From my experience, it felt like the services were always worse off in areas where poverty was higher. 
This observation got me thinking about the people who live in these communities. I knew my commute was long but were their's longer or more diffcult? 
How did that affect their daily lives?
</p>

<p>
For my Data Incubator Capstone project, I set out to use data to try and make sense of these observations and questions.
I wanted to identify areas where poverty was high and the commute times into the city were also high. 
My reasoning is that by identifying these areas, any special attention given would have a larger impact for the people living there.
</p>

<p>
The initial steps I took was to do some reading about the topic. 
Based on the literature, numerous studies indicate that having access to a reliable transportation system is crucial to escaping poverty. 
Here are some links to the interesting articles I found.

		Commute Times
	</a>
</h2>

<p>
I decided to focus my study on the borough of Queens to start. I needed an idea of what the commute times are within the borough. 
I decided to look at the problem on a zipcode basis. </p>
<p>Using Google Maps, 
I looked at what the commute times to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan were from every zipcode in Queens. 
I took the time of travel as a typical Monday morning during the 8 am rush hour. This is when the MTA system is said to be at its peak.
</p>

<p>
The choropleth below shows the commute times mapped out by zipcodes for queens. A more detailed interactive version of the map can be found
<a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_commute/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="map"></div>
	<script>
		var map = new L.Map("map", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
			//
			.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9irmi8cb48z2rn12y4nbq7o/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
		
		marker = L.marker([40.750259, -73.993589]).addTo(map);
		marker.bindPopup('Penn Station').openPopup();
	</script>


<p>
Penn Station was chosen as a reference point for the commute times because of the way the subway system in NYC
is designed. All subways (except the G train) travel through manhattan at some point in their routes. 
Penn station represents a economic hub within the city where there are a lot of opportunities.
</p>
<p> Darker shades of color indicate longer commute times. Click on the interactive map, <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_commute/" target="_blank">here</a>, 
for a more detailed version. At first glance the map makes sense. The further out from Manhattan you get, the longer your commute become.

    Areas of High Need
  </a>
</h2>

<p>The next step in my study was to identify the impoverished areas within queens. 
There are many ways to do this but I chose to keep it simple by looking at the numbers provided by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-returns-publication-1304-complete-report" target="_blank">Internal Revenue System</a>. 
More specifically, I looked at the number of returns filed that were under the federal guidelines for poverty.</p>
<p>The choropleth below represents these results.</p>
</div>
<div id="map2"></div>
<script>
	var map2 = new L.Map("map2", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
		.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9nnr66q3n0v2rtcm80zwgk3/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
</script>

<p>
Just like in the commute times map, darker shades indicate zipcodes that have higher number of poorer households (income less than $25000 per year for a family of 4). 
A more detailed version of this map can be found <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_returns/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There are a number of zipcodes with higher numbers of returns spread all over the borough. 
In order to identify the zipcodes that demonstrate high need we have to correlate the commute time data together with the tax return data. 
To do this and develop a "Need Score", I normalized the two data sets and combined them together to obtain a score. 
Because the range of the values of the number of returns feature varied much more greatly than the commute times feature, 
I performed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling" target="_blank">feature scaling</a> normalization on the tax return data set.
</p>

<p>
The choropleth below represents the Need Scores for each zipcode in queens.
</p>

<div id="map3"></div>
<script>
	var map3 = new L.Map("map3", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
		.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9qmzc3b0bit2rnvsz45zr3k/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
</script>

<p>
As with the previous choropleths, the darker colors indicate a higher Need score. 
A more detailed version of this map can be found <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_scores/" target="_blank">here</a>.
 These Need scores ranged from values of 0.008 to about 1.743. The zip codes with the highest Need scores and their summaries are listed below.

<p>
After doing this analysis and identifying which poor neighborhoods could use better transportation, I looked at how 
their commute times can be improved. 
This factor is key because several studies indicated that people who had higher (>60 minutes) commute times to get to work or school 
often performed worse economically than individuals whose commutes were shorter.

		Looking at Bus Times
	</a>
</h2>

<p>
Typically, travel within the city is two pronged; most people take buses to the nearest subways station, 
where trains can more quickly transport them through the city. I hypothesized that if there were any inefficiencies in the system, 
it would be within the bus routes. 
</p>

<p>
In this part of the study, I took a look at the massive (~5 GBs) historical GTFS database that the engineers at the MTA has on bustimes. 
A link to the database can be found <a href="http://data.mytransit.nyc/gtfs/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
Most of the information are contained in comma delimited text files.
</p>

<p>
Since this is a preliminary study, I looked at a small subset of the data. Specifically, I looked at the buses that ran in the 11434 zipcode.
I wanted to see if a preliminary insights can be drawn from the information.
</p>

<p>
The 11434 zip code contains the neighborhoods of Springfield Garden, South Jamaica, Rochdale, and St. Albans. 
The area has a population of about 60,000 people and is primarily served by five buses, the Q111, Q113, Q114, Q6, and the Q85. 
Looking at the <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_busMTA.htm" target="_blank">MTA ridership</a> information, two of those buses are in the top 10 for highest average weekday Ridership. 
</p>

<p>
Based on the numbers, the 11434 zip code has about a 22% poverty rate and the population is extremely dependent on the public transportation. 	
</p>	
<h2 id="technical-details">
	<a href="#technical-details">
		The Q111 Bus Route
	</a>
</h2>
<p>
Since the Q111 route was the most used route in the neighborhood and ranked 9th in the entire city in usage, I tackled its data first.	
</p>

<p>
The information provided in the dataset is absolutely expansive; it ranges way back to 2014 and provides historical data on the bus routes in the city. 
The data I was looking at was the arrival and departure times of buses at each stop along its route. 
</p>

<p>
After an arduous ETL process, I assembled a sqlite database of trips for the Q111 bus in 2016 and their respective stop times. 
I ended up reducing an overall database containing over 4 million rows to about 100k rows of only Q111 datapoints. 
That reduced database was further reduced to a table that only contained distinct trips and their trip times.
	</p>
<p>
During this process, I discovered some downsides to the data I was using. 
It didnt really contain data from ALL the buses that were running thoughout the day, but only some select trips. 
I suspected that this was really the data really represented the QC/QA trips that the MTA might run to adjust and set bus schedules. 
Regardless, the data was usable for the purposes of this project.
