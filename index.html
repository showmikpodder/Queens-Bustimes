<p>The transportation system in New York City has been a large part of my life growing up. 
Even though I grew up in Queens, I commuted to high school in downtown Brooklyn and graduate school in Harlem. 
This commute was a large part of my day and more often than not, the commute would take 60 to 90 minutes, one way.</p>

<p>
Despite this, I felt truly blessed and thankful for the Metropolitian Transportation Authority (MTA) for 
providing a service that allowed me to live in the greatest city in the world. 
Without them, getting around would seem almost impossible in a city of this scale.</p>

<p>
However, after using MTA services my entire life, I did notice some things.  
</p>
<p>
From my experience, it felt like the services were always worse off in areas where poverty was higher. 
This observation got me thinking about the people who live in these communities. I knew my commute was long but were their's longer or more diffcult? 
How did that affect their daily lives?
</p>

<p>
For my Data Incubator Capstone project, I set out to use data to try and make sense of these observations and questions.
I wanted to identify areas where poverty was high and the commute times into the city were also high. 
Any small improvements that the MTA can provide to these high need areas would have a greater impact and would be more appreciated.
</p>

<p>
The initial steps I took was to do some reading about the topic. 
Looking at the literature, numerous studies indicates that having 
access to an reliable transportation system is a crucial element in escaping poverty.
Here are some links to interesting articles I read.

		Commute Times
	</a>
</h2>

<p>
I decided to focus my study on the borough of Queens to start. I needed an idea of what the commute times are within the borough. 
I decided to look at the problem on a zipcode basis. </p>
<p>Using Google Maps, 
I looked at what the commute times to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan were from every zipcode in Queens. 
I took the time of travel as a typical Monday morning during the 8 am rush hour. This is when the MTA system is said to be at its peak.
</p>

<p>
The choropleth below shows the commute times mapped out by zipcodes for queens. A more detailed interactive version of the map can be found
<a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_commute/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="map"></div>
	<script>
		var map = new L.Map("map", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
			//
			.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9irmi8cb48z2rn12y4nbq7o/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
		
		marker = L.marker([40.750259, -73.993589]).addTo(map);
		marker.bindPopup('Penn Station').openPopup();
	</script>


<p>
Penn Station was chosen as a reference point for the commute times because of the way the subway system in NYC
is designed. All subways (except the G train) travel through manhattan at some point in their routes. 
Penn station represents a economic hub within the city where there are alot of opportunities.
</p>
<p> Darker shades of color indicate longer commute times. Click on the interactive map, <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_commute/" target="_blank">here</a>, 
for a more detailed version. At first glance the map makes sense, the further out from manhattan you get, the longer your commute times become.

    Areas of High Need
  </a>
</h2>

<p>The next step in my study was to identify the impoverished areas within queens. 
Theres many ways to do this but I chose to keep it simple and look at the numbers provided by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-returns-publication-1304-complete-report" target="_blank">Internal Revenue System</a>. 
Specifically, I looked at the number returns that were filed that were under the federal guidelines for poverty.</p>
<p>The choropleth below represents these results.</p>
</div>
<div id="map2"></div>
<script>
	var map2 = new L.Map("map2", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
		.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9nnr66q3n0v2rtcm80zwgk3/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
</script>

<p>
Just like in the commute times map, darker shades indicate zipcodes that have higher number of poorer households (income less than $25000 per year for a family of 4). 
A more detailed version of this map can be found <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_returns/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There are a number of zipcodes with higher numbers of returns spread all over the borough. 
In order to identify the zipcodes that demonstrate high need we have to correlate the commute time data together with the tax return data. 
To do this and develop a "Need Score", I normalized the two data sets and combined them together to obtain a score. 
Because the range of the values of the number of returns feature varied much more greatly than the commute times feature, 
I performed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling" target="_blank">feature scaling</a> normalization on the tax return data set.
</p>

<p>
The choropleth below represents the Need Scores for each zipcode in queens.
</p>

<div id="map3"></div>
<script>
	var map3 = new L.Map("map3", {center: [40.679870, -73.855513], zoom: 10.5})
		.addLayer(new L.TileLayer("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/spodder/cj9qmzc3b0bit2rnvsz45zr3k/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3BvZGRlciIsImEiOiJjajloZ25iMXMzODZuMndxbXNrdTM5bnd6In0.lN9vRRFe-MfxkmdYyQ2oKA"));
</script>

<p>
As with the previous choropleths, the darker colors indicate a higher Need score. 
A more detailed version of this map can be found <a href="https://showmikpodder.github.io/full_scr_scores/" target="_blank">here</a>.
 These Need scores ranged from values of 0.008 to about 1.743. The zip codes with the highest Need scores and their summaries are listed below.
</p>

	<tr>
		<th>Zipcode</th>
		<th>Commute Time</th>
		<th>Total Returns </th>
		<th>Need Score</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>78 minutes</td>

		<td>1.743</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>61 minutes</td>

	</tr>
</table>

<p>
After doing this analysis and identifying which poor neighborhoods could use better transportation, I looked at how 
their commute times can be improved. 
This factor is key because several studies indicated that people who had higher (>60 minutes) commute times to get to work or school 
often performed worse economically than individuals whose commutes were shorter.

		Looking at Bus Times
	</a>
</h2>

<p>
Typically, travel within the city is two pronged; most people take buses to the nearest subways station, 
where trains can more quickly transport them through the city. I hypothesized that if there were any inefficiencies in the system, 
it would be within the bus routes. 
</p>

<p>
In this part of the study, I took a look at the massive (~5 GBs) historical GTFS database that the engineers at the MTA has on bustimes. 
A link to the database can be found <a href="http://data.mytransit.nyc/gtfs/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since this is a preliminary study, I looked at a small subset of the data. Specifically, I looked at the buses that ran in the 11434 zipcode.
I wanted to see if a preliminary understanding can be done on the information.
